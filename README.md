# Gas Storage Pricing

This repository contains code and data for modeling and pricing natural gas storage contracts. The main goal is to extrapolate available market data to provide more granular insights into seasonal trends and future price estimates for natural gas. This information is crucial for accurately pricing commodity storage contracts, where clients agree to store an agreed quantity of natural gas in a warehouse for a specified period.

**Note:** This project was created as part of a virtual internship program on Forage for the position of Quantitative Research at JP Morgan Chase & Co.

## Project Overview

The key components of this project include:

1. Data preprocessing scripts to clean and format natural gas price data from various sources.
2. Time series analysis and forecasting models to capture seasonal patterns and trends in natural gas prices.
3. Pricing algorithms and simulations for natural gas storage contracts, incorporating factors like periodic storage fees, withdrawal/injection limits, and future price estimates.
4. Visualization tools for exploring historical data, forecasted prices, and contract pricing scenarios.

By leveraging this codebase, commodity trading desks can make informed decisions about natural gas storage contracts, optimizing strategies based on predicted price differentials across different seasons or time periods.
